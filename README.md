# KovitV Photography Website
Welcome to my photography website! This is a little project I am working on so I can show off my portfolio to people who are interested in my photography work. 
I am also using this oportunity to teach myself HTML and CSS. It has gone through a lot of changes since it started. Right now, it uses basic HTML and CSS code. 
I used to use a a JavaScript library to zoom into my images, but I have removed it in order to clean up some bugs. Eventually, I plan on using it again as noted 
in the Future Plans section below. 

### Usage  
**Go to https://kovirivo24.github.io/kovitvphotography/** 

### Future Plans
- Replace navbar letters with icons
- Create new pages for albums as more images get uploaded
- Use JavaScript library Medium Zoom
